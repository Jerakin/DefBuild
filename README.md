# DefBuild
Builder is built by wrapping adb/idevicebuilder and storing some data locally.

## Getting started

You will need some dependencies, if you are on mac they are easiy installed with brew.
If you are on windows you will have to download them from their websites, please note
that you can't use the iOS installation/build capabilities on a windows machine.

#### Dependencies

[Python 3.2+](https://www.python.org/) `brew install python3`

[adb](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb) `brew install android-platform-tools`

[ideviceinstaller](http://www.libimobiledevice.org/) `brew install ideviceinstaller`

#### Install

Install it with pip `pip install defbuild`

If you prefer you can clone and build the project yourself
